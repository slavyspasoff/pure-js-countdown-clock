# Coming Soon Page

Create a coming soon webpage. The page should show a count down of days, hours, minutes, and seconds.

- To run the app, try `$ npm i` and `$ npm run start`
- For an easier date handling, you can use a library such as [momentjs](https://momentjs.com) or better [luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/?id=luxon)
- Example of a completed project ![demo](./comingsoon.png)
- Inspired by https://dribbble.com/shots/5188890-Modern-Coming-Soon-Template

## Bonus: Coming Soon version 2.0

- work on your own github account
- add a form and let users choose a date  
- on click, it will show the countdown timer according to the given date
- style your app 
- deploy it and share a link!

* Remember, to update github repos is a good practice to show our progress throughout the course!
